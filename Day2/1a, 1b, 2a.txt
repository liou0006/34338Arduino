1a. 

We would need at least 4 binary bits to represent numbers from 0 to 9 but 4 bits are also able to represent numbers up to 15 

It would be an issue with morse codes because letters are represented using 1 to 4 "bits" therefore it would overlap each other.


1b.

The value of a after the loop will be a = 6
because the loop it increments 5 times as a is defined as 1 before the loop

2a. 
The operand is a remainder. Its function is to output a high signal (1) if the number it divides with becomes a fractional quiotient. Oherwise it outputs a low (0) when the division is exact with no remainder.
