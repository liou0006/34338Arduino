1a. 
We would need at least 4 binary bits to represent numbers from 0 to 9 but 4 bits are also able to represent numbers up to 15 

It would be an issue with morse codes because letters are represented using 1 to 4 "bits" therefore it would overlap each other.


1b.
The value of a after the loop will be a = 6
because the loop it increments 5 times as a is defined as 1 before the loop

2a. 
The operand is a remainder. Its function is to output a high signal (1) if the number it divides with becomes a fractional quotient. Otherwise it outputs a low (0) when the division is exact with no remainder.

2d. 
We can use the remainder operand with this line of code:

if counter % 7
	reset();

The condition of the if-statement will become true when the counter reaches the max, and it will reset.


3a.
INPUT_PULLUP is used to set up a virtual resistor that sets the input pins voltage to a constant high 

while INPUT outputs a random values on the pin without initializing the virtual resistors

3b.
! is a logical NOT 


3d.
It is in the wihle-loop so it is constant in terms of the refresh rate for the while loop.

It is reasonable unless it takes too much power from the system
